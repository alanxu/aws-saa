* Route 53 has the following routing policies - Simple, Weighted, Latency, Failover, Multivalue answer, Geoproximity. and Geolocation
* Route53 health check and fail over enable DR
* Route 53 has a security feature that prevents internal DNS from being read by external sources. The work around is to create a EC2 hosted DNS instance that does zone transfers from the internal DNS, and allows itself to be queried by external servers.
* Using an ALB will provide a very fault tolerant setup. When creating a record in Route 53 to other AWS resources, including ALB's, you should use Alias records where available. The alternate option of attaching Elastic IPs directly to the instances with an "A" record accomplishes similar results, but doesn't incur the cost of an ALB
